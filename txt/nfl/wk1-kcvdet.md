##Matchups To Watch

The Chiefs vs Lions is going to be an epic clash of talent to kick off the 2024 NFL Season. Here are 5 matchups to watch for:

<br>
- **Jared Goff vs Patrick Mahomes**: The two quarterbacks have faced each other twice before, both in 2018, when Goff was with the Rams and Mahomes was in his first year as a starter. Both games were high-scoring shootouts, with Goff throwing for 941 yards and eight touchdowns, and Mahomes throwing for 891 yards and 10 touchdowns. However, Goff won both games, 54-51 and 35-32. Can he repeat his success with a new team and a new system, or will Mahomes get his revenge and start his MVP campaign with a bang?

<br>
- **Aidan Hutchinson vs Donovan Smith and Jawaan Taylor**: The Lions' rookie edge rusher was the second overall pick in the draft, and he has a chance to make an immediate impact against the Chiefs' revamped offensive line. Hutchinson had 10.5 sacks and 18 tackles for loss in his final season at Michigan, and he has the size, speed, and power to disrupt any offense. The Chiefs signed Smith and Taylor in free agency to protect Mahomes' blindside and frontside, respectively, but they will have their hands full with Hutchinson's relentless pressure.

<br>
- **Mecole Hardman vs Jeff Okudah**: The Chiefs' receiver is one of the most explosive players in the league, capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. While he is not Tyreek Hill, his speed is next level and can cause havoc for defenses. The Lions' second-year cornerback is looking to bounce back from a disappointing rookie season, where he struggled with injuries and inconsistency. He was the third overall pick in 2020, and he has the talent and athleticism to be a lockdown defender. He will need to use his speed, technique, and physicality to keep up with Hill's deep routes and quick cuts.

<br>
- **Travis Kelce vs Tracy Walker**: The Chiefs' tight end is Mahomes' favorite target, and arguably the best player at his position in the league. He had 1,416 yards and 11 touchdowns last season, breaking the single-season record for receiving yards by a tight end. He is a mismatch for any defender, with his size, route-running, and hands. The Lions' safety is one of the few bright spots on their defense, as he led the team with 92 tackles last season. He also had four passes defended and an interception. He will need to use his range, instincts, and tackling ability to limit Kelce's impact.

<br>
- **Andy Reid vs Dan Campbell**: The Chiefs' head coach is one of the most respected and successful coaches in the league, with a career record of 221-130-1. He has led the Chiefs to five consecutive AFC West titles, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship. He is known for his innovative offense, aggressive play-calling, and clock management skills. The Lions' head coach is entering his third season with the team, after leading them to a 9-7 record and a playoff berth in 2022. He is known for his fiery personality, motivational speeches, and physical style of play.
