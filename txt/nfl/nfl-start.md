The wait is finally over. The 2023 NFL season is here, and it kicks off with a blockbuster game between the reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions. This is the first time these two teams will face each other since the 2019 season, when the Chiefs edged out the Lions 34-30 in a thrilling comeback. Will the Lions get their revenge, or will the Chiefs continue their dominance? Here are some reasons why you should tune in to watch the NFL season opener on Thursday night.

## The Chiefs are looking to make history
- After winning their second Super Bowl title in three years, the Chiefs have a chance to become the first team to win three consecutive Lombardi trophies since the New England Patriots did it from 2001 to 2004. Led by the dynamic duo of quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce, the Chiefs have one of the most explosive offenses in the league. They also added some key pieces to their defense, such as defensive end Frank Clark and safety Tyrann Mathieu, who will try to stop the Lions' attack.

## The Lions are hungry for a breakthrough 
- The Lions have not made the playoffs since 2016, and they have not won a playoff game since 1991. They have a new head coach in Dan Campbell, who is known for his fiery and passionate style. He has brought in some veteran leaders, such as quarterback Jared Goff and wide receiver Tyrell Williams, who have experience in big games. The Lions also have some young stars, such as running back D'Andre Swift and cornerback Jeff Okudah, who are eager to prove themselves on the big stage.

## The game will be a showcase of talent
- Both teams have some of the best players in the league at their positions. For the Chiefs, Mahomes is widely regarded as the best quarterback in the game, and Kelce is arguably the best tight end. They also have speedy receivers, such as Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman, who can stretch the field and create big plays. For the Lions, Goff is a former No. 1 overall pick who led the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl in 2018. He has a reliable target in Williams, who had over 1,000 yards receiving in 2019 with the Oakland Raiders. Swift is a versatile back who can run and catch out of the backfield, and Okudah is a lockdown corner who was the No. 3 overall pick in 2020.

## A spectacle of entertainment
- The NFL season opener is always a special event that features a pregame show with musical performances and celebrity appearances. This year, the show will be headlined by pop star Ariana Grande, who will perform her latest hit songs from her album "Sweetener". The game will also be broadcasted on NBC, with Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth providing commentary and analysis. You can also stream the game on Peacock, which is NBC's streaming service that offers live sports and events.
